Singly Linked List – In-Class Practice

    Create a class named LinkedList in a file named LinkedList.h
    Create a ListNode structure as a private member of the class. The node should be able to hold a string called value.
    Create a head & tail pointer as private attributes of the class.
    Create the following public member functions:
        A constructor, which will set both head & tail to NULL
        A destructor, which will traverse the linked list and delete each node
        A function called appendNode, which will accept a string as a parameter, create a new node with this string as its value, and append the node to the end of the list
        A function called displayList, which will traverse the linked list and print out the value in each node.
    Create a source file named Driver.cpp
        Create a main function that will create an instance of LinkedList called dogBreeds.
        Call the appendNode function 5 times sending the following dog breeds to the function:
            Corgi
            English Bulldog
            Dalmatian
            German Shepard
            Poodle
        Call the displayList function.
        Print out “Goodbye!”
